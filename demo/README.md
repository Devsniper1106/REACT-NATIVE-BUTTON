### Install react-community/create-react-native-app
For simplicity sake I've built the demo app on top of React Native's create-react-native-app. So in order to run the app first you need to globally install it. For more details: [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
```
npm install -g create-react-native-app
```

### Run the Demo App on iOS
Run the app and attempts to open the app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
```
npm run ios
```

### Run the Demo App on Android
Run the app and attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
```
npm run Android
```
