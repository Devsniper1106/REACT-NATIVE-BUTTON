### Install react-community/create-react-native-app

For simplicity sake I've built the demo app with Expo. So in order to run the app first you need to globally install `expo-cli`. For more details: [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Run the Demo App

Run the app and attempts to open the app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

```
expo start
```
